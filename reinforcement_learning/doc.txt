# Reinforcement Learning
- is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to 
maximize the notion of cumulative reward
- in simple terms: RL teaches a software agent how to behave in an environment by telling it how good it's doing

# Deep Q Learning
Extends Reinforcement Learning by using a deep Neural Network to predict the actions

# Agent 
- game 
- model

# Training
- state = get_state(game)
- action = get_move(state):
    - model.predict()
- reward, game_over, score = game.play_step(action)
- new_state = get_state(game)
- remember
- model.train()

## Game(Pygame)
- play_step(action) -> reward, game_over, score
## Model(PyTorch)
Linear_QNet(DQN)
- model.predict(state) -> action
