# Turtle
A package of Python for prescripted drawing.

# Basic steps
```py 
import turtle as t # RECOMMENDED TO USE TURTLE MODULE NAMESPACE LIKE THIS -> REMOVE TEDIOUS NAMING EVERYTIME CALLED UPON
from random import random
```

## Basic drawings
- forward(distance), backward(distance)
- left(angle), right(angle): angle with unit of degrees
- turtle.mainloop: to keep the display from being terminated unless interfered manually. _put at the end of script_
