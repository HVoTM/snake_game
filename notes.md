# Some of the key words used:
`pass` statement used in functions to be a placeholder for future code.
When the __pass__ statement is executed, nothing happens, but you avoid getting an error when empty code is not allowed. Empty code is not allowed in loops, function definitions, class definitions, or in if statements.
e.g.:
```py
def func1(x):
    pass
```
